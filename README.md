The file describes a way to store renewable energy for a long timee at ambient conditions without losses. The system gescribed transforms electricity to Hydrogen, which in turn is attached to a liquid organic carrier with an exothermic reaction. This liquid contains 2 kWh/kg and can be stored in large qquantities in steel tanks as any diesel or petreol. 
if afte month or year one wants to extract again electricity on has to add heat to the h2-containing liquid, which may come from the fuel-cell or gasturbine using the extracted H2 to produce electricty. The system is known as LOHC.
